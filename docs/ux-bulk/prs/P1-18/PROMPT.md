# P1-18 — Daily wage: imported drafts are invisible
Base: origin/main c942563f · Branch: fix/dw-drafts-visible · Worktree: /home/claude/wt-p1-18 · Port: 3118
Master plan: docs/ux-bulk/MASTER_PLAN.md (read with: git -C /home/claude/wt-docs show HEAD:docs/ux-bulk/MASTER_PLAN.md) — §6 P1-18, §9 D-1.
## Finding D-1
Daily Wage batch import creates entries as drafts, but the done screen does not say so and the Records page has no way
to see / submit drafts or "needs correction" rows, so imported work sits unseen.
## Scope
Import done screen: "N drafts created — Submit all now" (uses the EXISTING submit endpoint(s); no new backend route
unless none exists — then STOP and ask). Records page: Draft and Needs-correction count cards that filter the list.
Check production (counts only): dw_entries by status.
## Owned files
frontend/src/pages/DailyWageBatchImport.jsx · frontend/src/pages/DailyWageRecords.jsx (read routes/dailyWage.js; do not edit
it unless the planner agrees).
## Verify
Playwright (hr): import fictional file → done screen count → Submit all → rows move to submitted; Records cards count +
filter; 0 errors. `--base`: no draft count, drafts not findable.

## RESUME (re-read after any compaction)
- Progress: docs/ux-bulk/prs/P1-18/PROGRESS.md — update + commit + push after EVERY small step. Never redo a ticked step.
- Owner gave a programme-level "go" ("run through so we finish"). The PLANNER approves your Phase 0:
  Phase 0 = read code, read-only diagnostics, write PLAN.md (files + functions + smallest change + tests + risks +
  questions), commit + push PLAN.md and PROGRESS.md, then STOP and report "Phase 0 ready". Wait for "go".

## FILE OWNERSHIP (new rule — this is what stops PRs conflicting)
Six builders run in parallel. You may edit ONLY the files under "Owned files" plus new files you create
(tests, check script, docs/ux-bulk/prs/P1-18/*). If the fix needs any other existing file, STOP and ask the planner —
another builder may own it. NEVER commit frontend/dist (it is in .gitignore; Railway + CI build it).
NEVER edit CLAUDE.md — your session notes go in docs/ux-bulk/prs/P1-18/PROGRESS.md under "## CLAUDE.md entry".

## DO NOT MODIFY
Global (MASTER_PLAN §10.4): salaryComputation.js, dayCalculation.js, schema.js, payroll.js, recompute.js, Stage 7
register (SalaryComputation.jsx), ED finance-review flow, loans engine. Plus every file you do not own.

## Build rules
- One finding (or the listed group) = this PR only. Repo is PUBLIC: fictional test data only; no real names, codes,
  account numbers or per-person money anywhere (code, tests, logs, docs, PR text). Production = read-only, counts only.
- Work ONLY in your worktree. node_modules are symlinks to the main repo (never commit them).
- Browser checks: PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers, scratch DB, real logins, a LOCAL frontend build, your port
  only. Pattern: backend/scripts/salary-register-report-check.py. Prove the bug once with `--base` on an origin/main build.
- Shared machine: `flock /tmp/vite.lock npm run build --prefix frontend`; full jest as `flock /tmp/jest.lock npx jest`
  (single test files need no lock). Never `pkill` broadly — kill only PIDs you started.
- jest full suite before and after (record suites/tests). Self-debug + user simulation (happy path + ≥1 edge) + v2.

## Hand-off
1. `git fetch origin main && git merge --no-edit origin/main` (merge, never rebase/force-push); if it conflicts on a
   file you own, resolve; on a file you do not own, STOP and report. Re-run jest + your check after the merge.

3. Push; verify with `git ls-remote origin <branch>` == `git rev-parse HEAD`. Do NOT open or merge a PR.
4. Report: built / caught / tested (counts) / not tested (why) / final SHA / files changed list / new findings.
